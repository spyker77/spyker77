# Welcome to my GitHub profile!

👀 I'm Evgeni, a self-taught Python developer who started this journey in mid-2018.

🇧🇾 Right now you can find me in Minsk, Belarus, but I stay open-minded about the future...

🐈 In my spare time I work on [SkillHunter](https://skillhunter.app/) – an attempt to create something meaningful while mastering my skills.

🔭 I also constantly explore the world of tech by reading, practicing and occasionally writing like [this](https://dev.to/spyker77/how-to-connect-godaddy-domain-with-heroku-and-cloudflare-mdh) or [that](https://hackernoon.com/openapi-30-schema-with-swagger-ui-for-django-restful-app-4w293zje).

💬 In case you wanna drop me a line, go to my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/evgeni-sautin/) page and let's have a chit-chat!

🍵 Or if you just need a partner to enjoy some good Chinese tea in a relaxed atmosphere, I'm here for you.
